If you are a fan of the Initial D manga and anime series, you might be interested in playing the arcade racing game based on it. Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity is a 2014 game developed by Sega that features realistic physics, car customization, and online multiplayer modes. However, the game is only available for Sega RingEdge 2 arcade machines, which are not easy to find outside Japan. Fortunately, there is a way to play this game on your PC using an emulator called TeknoParrot.
 
TeknoParrot is a software that allows you to run arcade games designed for Windows-based hardware on your PC. It supports many popular titles such as Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 5, and of course, Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity. To play this game on your PC, you will need the following:
