## Real-Time Mode
 
Real-Time Mode is the core of SIA Smaart Live 7. It allows you to perform real-time measurements of the frequency spectrum, phase response, coherence, and impulse response of any sound source or system. You can use multiple input channels and configure them as single or dual-channel measurements. You can also use different types of filters, averaging, smoothing, delay, and compensation to adjust the measurement parameters.
 
Real-Time Mode has four main windows: RTA, Spectrograph, Transfer Function, and Live IR. The RTA window shows the frequency spectrum of the input signal in a linear or logarithmic scale. The Spectrograph window shows the frequency spectrum over time in a waterfall or spectrogram display. The Transfer Function window shows the magnitude and phase response of the ratio between two input signals, as well as the coherence and impulse response. The Live IR window shows the impulse response of the input signal or the transfer function in a linear or logarithmic scale.
 
To use Real-Time Mode, you need to connect your audio interface to your computer and select it as the input device in SIA Smaart Live 7. You also need to calibrate your input levels and set up your measurement configuration. You can then start measuring by clicking on the Start button or pressing the spacebar.
  
## Impulse Response Mode
 
Impulse Response Mode is a specialized mode that allows you to measure and analyze the impulse response of any sound system or acoustic environment. It uses a swept sine wave or a maximum length sequence (MLS) as the test signal and records the output signal with a microphone or a direct connection. It then calculates the impulse response by using a deconvolution algorithm.
 
Impulse Response Mode has two main windows: IR Record and IR Analysis. The IR Record window allows you to set up your test signal parameters, input device settings, recording options, and trigger modes. The IR Analysis window allows you to view and edit your recorded impulse response files, as well as perform various calculations such as energy time curve (ETC), reverberation time (RT), early decay time (EDT), clarity (C), definition (D), center time (TS), speech transmission index (STI), and more.
 
To use Impulse Response Mode, you need to connect your audio interface to your computer and select it as the input device in SIA Smaart Live 7. You also need to connect your test signal source to your sound system or acoustic environment and your microphone or direct connection to your audio interface. You can then start recording by clicking on the Record button or pressing Ctrl+R.
  
## SPL Mode
 
SPL Mode is a dedicated mode that allows you to measure and log the sound pressure level (SPL) of any sound source or system. It uses one or more input channels as SPL meters and displays the SPL values in various formats such as A-weighted, C-weighted, Z-weighted, Leq, Lmax, Lmin, Lpeak, etc. It also allows you to set up SPL alarms, calibrate your SPL meters, and export your SPL logs.
 
SPL Mode has one main window: SPL Metering. The SPL Metering window shows the SPL values of each input channel in a numeric or graphical display. You can also view the SPL history over time in a chart or table format. You can also access the SPL settings menu by clicking on the gear icon or pressing F5.
 
To use SPL Mode, you need to connect your audio interface to your computer
